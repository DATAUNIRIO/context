# Inequality Measurement {#inequality}

## Lorenz Curve (svylorenz)

Though not an inequality measure in itself, the Lorenz curve is a classic instrument of distribution analysis. Basically, it is a function that associates a cumulative share of the population and the share of the total income it owns. In mathematical terms, 

\[
L(p) = \frac{\int_{-\infty}^{Q_p}yf(y)dy}{\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}yf(y)dy}
\]

where $Q_p$ is the quantile $p$ of the population.

The two extreme distributive cases are 

- Perfect equality:
    - Every individual has the same income;
    - Every share of the population has the same share of the income;
    - Therefore, the reference curve is \[L(p) = p \text{ } \forall p \in [0,1] \text{.}\].
- Perfect inequality:
    - One individual concentrates all of society's income, while the other individuals have zero income;
    - Therefore, the reference curve is 
    
\[
L(p)=
\begin{cases}
0, &\forall p < 1 \\
1, &\text{if } p = 1 \text{.}
\end{cases}
\]
    
In order to evaluate the degree of inequality in a society, the analyst looks at the distance between the real curve and those two reference curves.

The estimation procedures are based in the equation set out in [@kovacevic1997]:

\[
L(p) = \frac{1}{\widehat{Y}} \cdot \sum_{i \in S} y_i \text{ } \delta \{ y_i \le \widehat{ Q_p } \}, \text{ } 0 \le p \le 1.
\]

Yet, this formula is used to calculate specific points of the curve and their respective SEs. The formula to plot an approximation of the continuous empirical curve comes from [@lerman1989].

## Measures derived from the Lorenz Curve

### Gini index (svygini)

The Gini index is an attempt to express the inequality presented in the Lorenz curve as a single number. In essence, the Gini index is twice the area between the equality curve and the real Lorenz curve. Put simply:

\[
\begin{aligned}
G &= 2 \bigg( \int_{0}^{1} pdp - \int_{0}^{1} L(p)dp \bigg) \\
\therefore G &= 1 - 2 \int_{0}^{1} L(p)dp
\end{aligned}
\]

where $G=0$ in case of perfect equality and $G = 1$ in the case of perfect inequality.

The estimator proposed by [@osier2009] is defined as:

\[
\widehat{G} = \frac{ 2 \sum_{i \in S} w_i r_i y_i - \sum_{i \in S} w_i y_i }{ \hat{Y} }
\]

The linearized formula of $\widehat{G}$ is used to calculate the SE.

### Amato index (svyamato)

The Amato index is also based on the Lorenz curve, but instead of focusing on the area of the curve, it focuses on its length. [@arnold2012] proposes a formula not directly based in the Lorenz curve, which [@barabesi2016] uses to present the following estimator:

\[
\widehat{A} = \sum_{i \in S} w_i \bigg[ \frac{1}{\widehat{N}^2} + \frac{y_i^2}{\widehat{Y}^2} \bigg]^{\frac{1}{2}} \text{,}
\]

which also generates the linearized formula for SE estimation.

The minimum value $A$ assumes is $\sqrt{2}$ and the maximum is $2$. In order to get a measure in the interval $[0,1]$, the standardized Amato index $\widetilde{A}$ can be defined as:

\[
\widetilde{A} = \frac{ A - \sqrt{2} }{2 - \sqrt{2} } \text{ .}
\]

### Zenga Index and Curve (svyzenga, svyzengacurve)

The Zenga index and its curve were proposed in [@zenga2007]. As [@polisicchio2011] noticed, this curve derives directly from the Lorenz curve, and can be defined as:

\[
Z(p) = 1 - \frac{L(p)}{p} \cdot \frac{1 - p}{1 - L(p)}.
\]

In the `convey` library, an experimental estimator based on the Lorenz curve is used:

\[
\widehat{Z(p)} = \frac{ p \widehat{Y} - \widehat{\widetilde{Y}}(p) }{p \big[ \widehat{Y} - \widehat{\widetilde{Y}}(p) \big] }.
\]

In turn, the Zenga index derives from this curve and is defined as:

\[
Z = \int_0^1 Z(p)dp.
\]

However, its estimators were proposed by [@langel2012] and [@barabesi2016]. In this library, latter is used and is defined as:

\[
\widehat{Z} = 1 - \sum_{i \in S} w_i \bigg[ \frac{ ( \widehat{N} - \widehat{H}_{y_i} ) ( \widehat{Y} -\widehat{K}_{y_i} ) }
{ \widehat{N} \cdot \widehat{H}_{y_i} \cdot \widehat{K}_{y_i} } \bigg]
\]

where $\widehat{N}$ is the population total, $\widehat{Y}$ is the total income, $\widehat{H}_{y_i}$ is the sum of incomes below or equal to $y_i$ and $\widehat{N}_{y_i}$ is the sum of incomes greater or equal to $y_i$.
