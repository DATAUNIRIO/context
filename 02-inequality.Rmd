# Inequality Measurement {#inequality}

[Present an introduction to what is inequality].

## Theoretical aspects of inequality

### Desirable properties of inequality measures

## Lorenz Curve (svylorenz)

here are the references

## Measures derived from the Lorenz Curve

### Gini index (svygini)

here are the references

[@osier2009] and [@deville1999]

### Amato index (svyamato)

### Zenga Index and Curve (svyzenga, svyzengacurve)

guilherme..this has three references?  not just two?

here are the references
