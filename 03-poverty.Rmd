# Poverty Indices  {#poverty}

[I think this is a good start. 
I don't think that gender pay gap, quantiles and totals are measures of poverty. Consider another chapter on other wellbeing measures.]

## At Risk of Poverty Ratio and Threshold (svyarpr and svyarpt)

## The Gender Pay Gap (svygpg)

## Quintile Share Ratio (svyqsr)

## Relative Median Income Ratio (svyrmir)

## Relative Median Poverty Gap (svyrmpg)

## Median Income Below the At Risk of Poverty Threshold  (svypoormed)

## Quantiles (svyiqalpha)

## Totals (svyisq)
